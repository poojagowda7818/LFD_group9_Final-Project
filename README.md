# LFD_group9_Final-Project
1. Clone the Github repository
2. Then install the requirements.
    - pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Go to this [Link]:"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-RDNNy3P-DS8sK2TtC-98CSrGaybtKYZ?usp=share_link" to download and copy files inside the folders to the corresponding folders in the Github repository. For example, Glove pre-trained word-embedding, pre-trained models,processed data.
# Experiments with respect to research question:
Research Questions:
1. Which of models is best classification models?
2. Does POS tagging of tweets improve SVM classification performance?


The experiments performed with respect to research question can be found in folder "Experiment" and following files within are:
1. Classic Model without Pos tag and with Postag - Classic baseline model, Also we perform experiments related to research question 2.
2. Classic Model with custom features.ipynb - this model works with other different features with respect to research question 1.
3. LSTM_FinalProject.ipynb - related to research question 1.
4. PLM.ipynb - related to research question 1.

# Running instructions:
1. Preferably run these scripts on colab by changing the runtime type to "GPU"
2. There are several boolean conditions set accordingly to conduct the experiments,set it to True or False accordingly.
